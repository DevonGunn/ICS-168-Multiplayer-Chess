# ICS-168-Multiplayer-Chess

Project repository for ICS 168

'p' - toggles debug console (which is on by default since this is an alpha build) 'esc' - toggles menu when in singleplayer mode

Notes:

Currently the executable needs to be run directly from the debug directory since I'm not sure how to make visual studio search for includes via a relative path. I've been trying to figure it out for a while with fruitless results. I will figure it out eventually though, and then the game will be able to be run on computers that are not my own, from visual studio directly.

The game relies on the players having a working knowledge of how chess works, just like in a real-world game. Players are not restricted in how or when they can move their pieces, it's up to them to manage themselves.

If you place two pieces next to each other and then click a point that intersects between them it will move both pieces. Click only the edge of one of them to move only a single piece in this instance.

Known Issues:

There is some slight misalignment of the pieces and intro screen. This is an art problem, not a technical problem, and will be fixed in the next milestone, I haven't had the leisure of being picky about art due to working alone.

The black pieces are hard to see on black squares. I'll figure something out.
